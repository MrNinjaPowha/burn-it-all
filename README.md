# Burn It All

A clicker-game where you try to emit as much CO<sub>2</sub> as possible into the atmosphere.

You have to create new vehicles or buildings to burn fuel, and then upgrade these buildings or switch to more inefficient fuels, in order to emit carbon without having to click the button.

It is built using [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) and deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
